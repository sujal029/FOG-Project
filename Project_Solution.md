Process a longer video to generate a short video that can be shared as a reel/shorts/story, etc.
	
Task -
➔	Given a longer video as input (download this), your goal is to process it and generate a 30s short video (very important - output aspect ratio - 9:16) that is captivating and shareable on social media. Don’t resize, instead use a specific part of the larger frame in your short video.
➔	You can predetermine interesting clips and give them as input to the code. For example - you might determine a video to have interesting clips between 5-9, 15-20, 35-40, etc. and provide that as input to the code along with the video.
➔	What makes a short video captivating - watch
●	Music - use upbeat/hip-hop, etc.
●	Transitions - good transitions synced with music
●	Text overlays - short texts to describe what’s in the video
➔	Add your creativity to make the video attractive and fun to watch!

Answer
1.	Share a link to the short video you generated (make sure it’s viewable)

3. Describe your high-level approach to solve this problem.

The task involves creating a short, visually engaging video by extracting specific clips from a longer video, enhancing them with effects, adding background music, and overlaying text. Below is the structured and justified explanation of the approach:

1. Libraries and Tools Used
●	Python: Utilized as the primary programming language for its robust libraries and simplicity.
●	MoviePy: Core library for handling video and audio editing, including: 
o	Loading and processing video and audio files.
o	Applying effects, transitions, and overlays.
o	Combining multiple video and audio components into a cohesive final product.
●	os: Used to verify the existence of input files and manage file paths effectively.

2. Algorithm and Workflow
●	Input Validation:
Before processing, the script verifies the existence of the input video and audio files. Clip times are also validated to ensure they are within the video duration and logically ordered (start time must be less than end time).
●	Video Preprocessing:
The input video is loaded using VideoFileClip and resized to a 9:16 aspect ratio (portrait mode) to fit platforms like TikTok or Instagram. Cropping and resizing ensure the content is centered while maintaining clarity.
●	Clip Extraction and Enhancements:
Specific segments of the video are extracted using the provided clip times. Each clip is enhanced with:
o	Zoom-In Effect: Focus on key elements by resizing the frame slightly.
o	Pan Effect: Dynamically shift the frame's focus for added visual appeal. Smooth transitions between clips are added using crossfade effects.
●	Audio Integration:
Background music is loaded using AudioFileClip and trimmed to match the video duration. A fade-in effect is applied to the audio for smoother transitions. The original video’s audio is replaced with this processed music.
●	Text Overlays:
Timestamped text clips are created for each video segment using TextClip. These text elements are styled and positioned dynamically on the video to add context or captions.
●	
●	Final Assembly and Export:
The processed video clips, text overlays, and background music are combined into a single cohesive video using CompositeVideoClip. If the video duration is less than 30 seconds, the last clip is looped to extend its length. 
3. Workflow Summary
●	Input: Video file, music file,  and text overlays. 
●	Validate inputs.
●	Resize and crop the video to 9:16 aspect ratio.
●	Extract and enhance clips with effects and transitions.
●	Add background music and text overlays.
●	Output: A short, polished video ready for sharing on social media platforms.







Question 3
What is the most complex python application you have worked on in the domain of computer vision / video processing? Tell us a little bit about what you did. Attach screenshots where required.
Answer
The Most Complex Python Application I’ve Worked On in Computer Vision / Video Processing is AI-Driven Personal Fitness Tracker - Structured Approach
1. Libraries and Tools Used
•	Python: The primary programming language for backend logic and implementing AI models.
•	Flask/Django: The web framework used to create an interactive user interface for tracking fitness data.
•	TensorFlow/PyTorch: Libraries for implementing AI models that recommend personalized workouts based on user data.
•	OpenCV: Used to detect and analyze exercise motions through webcam or video inputs.
•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating fitness progress graphs and visualizations.
•	SQLite/MySQL: Databases for storing user data, workout logs, and progress.
•	Twilio/SMTP: For sending workout reminders, progress updates, and reports to users via SMS or email.
2. Algorithm and Workflow
•	Input Validation:
o	The system verifies the user's profile information, including fitness goals, preferences, and workout history.
o	Ensures that input data (e.g., workout logs, video inputs) is properly formatted and compatible with the system.
•	User Profile Setup:
o	Users input their data (age, weight, fitness goals, etc.) through a simple web form.
o	This data is stored in a database, and the system uses it to tailor workout recommendations.
•	Exercise Motion Detection (Optional):
o	Using OpenCV, real-time video inputs (webcam or pre-recorded video) are processed to detect if users are performing exercises correctly.
o	The system analyzes body movements for accuracy (e.g., push-up form, squat depth) and provides feedback on posture, form, and execution.
•	Workout Recommendation System:
o	Based on the user’s fitness goals and progress, the AI model (using TensorFlow/PyTorch) suggests personalized workouts.
o	The model considers:
	Previous workout history.
	Current fitness levels.
	Equipment availability.
	Intensity adjustments (progressing from easier to harder exercises).
•	Progress Tracking and Visualization:
o	As users log their workouts, their progress is tracked over time, including metrics like calories burned, weight lost, and strength improvements.
o	Matplotlib/Seaborn is used to generate fitness graphs and charts, which are displayed on the user's dashboard.
o	Users can view:
	Calories burned per session.
	Total reps or sets performed.
	Weight loss over time.
•	Automated Reminders and Reports:
o	The system sends reminders for workouts, rest days, or hydration via SMS using Twilio or email through SMTP.
o	Weekly progress reports are automatically sent to users, summarizing their workout consistency, improvements, and fitness achievements.
•	Final Dashboard and User Interface:
o	A web-based dashboard is created with Flask/Django, providing an easy-to-use interface where users can:
	View personalized workout plans.
	Track daily and weekly progress.
	Set goals and adjust preferences.
o	The interface also allows users to log meals and track nutrition (if integrated).
3. Workflow Summary
•	Input: User profile data, workout logs, webcam/video input for exercise analysis.
•	Steps:
1.	User creates a profile and sets up fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).
2.	The system tracks workout activities and provides exercise feedback through video analysis (if webcam is used).
3.	AI models suggest personalized workouts based on past performance, current fitness level, and goals.
4.	User progress is visualized through fitness graphs generated with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
5.	Automated reminders and progress reports are sent via SMS/email.
•	Output: A personalized, AI-driven fitness tracker that helps users achieve their health goals by providing customized workouts, form feedback, and progress tracking.
